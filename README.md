## About The Project

Simplest way to download clips on Twitch!  
Twitch Clip Downloader adds a simple download button on the clips overview page.

It's the easiest way to download Twitch clip without quality less.  
Just click on the download button!

Are you afraid of losing clips youâ€™ve made a long time ago?  
On the Clips Manager page, you can download all the clips you selected at the same time.

No need to rename a clip!  
To save time, clips will be renamed with the naming convention : *"Streamer - Category - Clip title.mp4"*
